Creating VPN accounts for OpenVPN basically means generating separate client credentials (certificates + keys) for each user or device that will connect. Here's how to **create multiple OpenVPN client accounts**, step-by-step:

---

## 🆕 Create a New OpenVPN Client Account

### 🧰 Prerequisites:

You should already be inside your `~/openvpn-ca` directory (or wherever you initialized Easy-RSA). If not:

```
cd ~/openvpn-ca
source vars  # only if you're using Easy-RSA v2, for v3 skip this

```

---

### ✅ Step 1: Generate a new client certificate and key

Replace `client2` with your desired username or device name.

```
./easyrsa gen-req client2 nopass
./easyrsa sign-req client client2

```

- Say `yes` when asked to confirm signing.
- You now have:
  - `pki/private/client2.key`
  - `pki/issued/client2.crt`

---

### ✅ Step 2: Prepare client config files

You need these files for the client:

- `client.ovpn` (base config)
- `ca.crt`
- `client2.crt`
- `client2.key`
- `ta.key`

---

### 🧾 Example client config: `client2.ovpn`

Create this file (or copy and edit from `client1.ovpn`):

```
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote your.public.ip.or.ddns 1194
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun

<ca>
# Paste content of ca.crt
</ca>

<cert>
# Paste content of client2.crt
</cert>

<key>
# Paste content of client2.key
</key>

<tls-auth>
# Paste content of ta.key
</tls-auth>

tls-auth ta.key 1
cipher AES-256-CBC
auth SHA256
verb 3

```

Or use separate files if preferred, and reference like:

```
ca ca.crt
cert client2.crt
key client2.key
tls-auth ta.key 1

```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Transfer the client files

You can use:

- **SCP**:

  ```
  scp client2.ovpn user@clientmachine:/path/
  
  ```

- **USB drive**

- Or ZIP and email it (not recommended unless encrypted)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Import into OpenVPN Client

Use the OpenVPN GUI on Windows/Linux, or the OpenVPN Connect app on Android/iOS to import the `.ovpn` config file and connect.

---

## 🔁 Repeat for more users

Just repeat:

```
./easyrsa gen-req clientX nopass
./easyrsa sign-req client clientX

```

And prepare their respective `.ovpn` files.

---

Would you like a script that automates new account creation and bundles a ready-to-import `.ovpn` file for clients?
